# KCC2-in-Subiculum

This is the code implementing the single neuron and spiking neural network dynamics. The network has the dynamic ion concentrations of
extracellular potassium and intracellular chloride. The correspoding paper will be published in the Journal of Neuroscience, http://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/46/11619. The code also contains multiple parameter variations to study various mechanisms of the neural excitability.

For simplicity the code has been organized by paper Figures to reproduce simulation results. Every subfolder contains a Matlab script that contains the model parameters and integration of the model equations. When simulations are finished it would automatickally run the visualization of the results and plot them in Matlab.

In you need any advice how to run simulations, do not hestitate to contact me.
