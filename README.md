# KCC2-in-Subiculum

This is the code implementing the single neuron and spiking neural network dynamics. The network has the dynamic ion concentrations of
extracellular potassium and intracellular chloride. The correspoding paper will be published in the Journal of Neuroscience, http://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/46/11619. The code also contains multiple parameter variations to study various mechanisms of the neural excitability.

If you will use this code for publication, do not forget to cite our paper.


In you need any advice how to run simulations, do not hestitate to contact me.
